= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

.request
include::{docdir}/roomManagershouldReturnFilledResponse/curl-request.adoc

.response
include::{docdir}/roomManagershouldReturnFilledResponse/http-response.adoc

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
